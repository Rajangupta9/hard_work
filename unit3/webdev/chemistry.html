    <h1>Chemistry assingnment</h1>
    <p>Chemisty is the branch of science that 
        deals with the properties , composition, and behavior of matter.
        It is fascinating field that explores that explore the building of the 
        universe.

    <h2>Chemistry Element</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.
        Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron.
        H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and
        periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>chemical reaction are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of 
        a <i>chemical reaction:</i>
    </p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equations represented the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and 
        oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
        <sub>Subscripts</sub> Indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>
        represent charges or the number of atoms m an Ion.</p>
    
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a cnrcial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our
            lives. </p>
