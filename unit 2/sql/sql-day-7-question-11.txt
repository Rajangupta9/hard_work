Query 1: The Overpopulated Planets
Retrieve the names and populations of planets in each galaxy where the population exceeds the average population of all planets in that galaxy by more than 20%.


SELECT 
    planet_name, 
    population, 
    galaxy 
FROM 
    planets AS p
WHERE 
    population > (
        SELECT AVG(population) * 1.2
        FROM planets
        WHERE galaxy = p.galaxy
    );

Query 2: Top Resource Planets
Identify the planets that have the highest quantity of each type of resource. Return the planet name and the quantity of the resource.


SELECT 
    r.resource_name, 
    p.planet_name, 
    r.quantity 
FROM 
    resources AS r
JOIN planets AS p
    ON r.planet_id = p.planet_id
WHERE 
    (r.resource_name, r.quantity) IN (
        SELECT 
            resource_name, 
            MAX(quantity) 
        FROM resources 
        GROUP BY resource_name
    );

Query 3: Leading Colonist Professions
Create a view LeadingProfessions that lists the top 3 professions (by the number of colonists) for each planet.


CREATE VIEW LeadingProfessions AS
SELECT 
    p.planet_name, 
    c.profession, 
    COUNT(c.colonist_id) AS colonist_count
FROM 
    colonists AS c
JOIN planets AS p 
    ON c.planet_id = p.planet_id
GROUP BY 
    p.planet_name, 
    c.profession
ORDER BY 
    p.planet_name, 
    colonist_count DESC
LIMIT 3;

Query 4: Cross-Galaxy Space Station Capacity
Using a CTE, calculate the total capacity of space stations within each galaxy. Return the names of galaxies where the total capacity exceeds the combined capacity of all space stations in the galaxy with the median total capacity.


WITH StationCapacity AS (
    SELECT 
        galaxy, 
        SUM(capacity) AS total_capacity
    FROM 
        space_stations AS ss
    JOIN planets AS p 
        ON ss.planet_id = p.planet_id
    GROUP BY galaxy
),
MedianCapacity AS (
    SELECT 
        AVG(total_capacity) AS median_capacity
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            total_capacity 
        FROM StationCapacity
        ORDER BY total_capacity
        LIMIT 2 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM StationCapacity) / 2
    ) AS med
)
SELECT 
    galaxy, 
    total_capacity 
FROM 
    StationCapacity
WHERE 
    total_capacity > (SELECT median_capacity FROM MedianCapacity);
This uses two CTEs: one to calculate the total capacity of space stations in each galaxy and another to calculate the median total capacity. Finally, it filters galaxies where the total capacity exceeds the median.

Query 5: Resource Distribution Analysis
Identify the planets that have a surplus of resources. A planet is considered to have a surplus if the quantity of any resource is more than double the average quantity of that resource across all planets.


WITH ResourceAvg AS (
    SELECT 
        resource_name, 
        AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM 
        resources
    GROUP BY resource_name
)
SELECT 
    r.planet_id, 
    p.planet_name, 
    r.resource_name, 
    r.quantity 
FROM 
    resources AS r
JOIN planets AS p 
    ON r.planet_id = p.planet_id
JOIN ResourceAvg AS ra 
    ON r.resource_name = ra.resource_name
WHERE 
    r.quantity > 2 * ra.avg_quantity;
This query uses a CTE to calculate the average quantity of each resource across all planets, then finds planets where the quantity of any resource is more than double the average.
